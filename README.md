# E-commerce data analysis & customer segmentation

**About the Project**

Dataset: Kaggle – E-Commerce Data (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carrie1/ecommerce-data)

Language: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)

Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Power BI

**Objectives**

Explore customer purchasing behavior

Calculate metrics such as average ticket, total revenue, and purchase frequency

Perform RFM analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)

Create an interactive dashboard in Power BI

**Data Cleaning & Transformation**

Removed null values in CustomerID

Excluded return transactions (InvoiceNo starting with "C")

Created a new column: TotalPrice = Quantity × UnitPrice

**Analyses Performed**

Sales by country

Top-selling products

Average revenue per customer

RFM analysis for customer segmentation
